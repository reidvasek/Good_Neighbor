      <h1>Ever baked a batch of cookies and needed an extra egg? Your friendly Good Neighbor app is here for you! </h1>
      <p>Ever baked a batch of cookies and needed an extra egg? You would either have to ask a neighbor if they had any spare eggs or go to the supermarket. Going to the store requires putting on real clothes and is just a hassle. If your like us and are lazy, asking a neighbor is by far the best option.

    In this day in age not knowing your neighbors is pretty common. If you don't know someone, going up to them and asking for something is just plain awkward. If they don't lend you an extra egg, then you will always know them as the neighbors who don't like lending things and you will be known as the neighborhood mooch.

    Enter Good Neighbor. Our goal is to create a community network that will connect the eggless with the couple whose eggs might spoil because they decided to go for that giant rack of eggs from Costco.
