      <h1>Ever baked a batch of cookies and needed an extra egg? Your friendly Good Neighbor app is here for you! </h1>
      <p>Ever baked a batch of cookies and needed an extra egg? You would either have to ask a neighbor if they had any spare eggs or go to the supermarket. Going to the store requires putting on real clothes and is just a hassle. If your like us and are lazy, asking a neighbor is by far the best option.

    In this day in age not knowing your neighbors is pretty common. If you don't know someone, going up to them and asking for something is just plain awkward. If they don't lend you an extra egg, then you will always know them as the neighbors who don't like lending things and you will be known as the neighborhood mooch.

    Enter Good Neighbor. Our goal is to create a community network that will connect the eggless with the couple whose eggs might spoil because they decided to go for that giant rack of eggs from Costco.

    <h3> <em> How do I use this site?</em></h3>
    <p> Click on the postings tab. Then scan the postings for items that you might like. If you have items that you would like to post there is a posting bar at the top. </p> 
    <h3> <em> Will my address be displayed to other users? </em></h3> <p> That would be a little creepy. No, your address will not be displayed. However, it will be used in our algorithm to show the distance between yourself and the other posters, that way you don't respond to posters hours away from you (feel free to respond to posters hours away from you). </p>
    <h3> <em> How do I setup Good Neighbor exchanges? </em></h3><p> The email adresses of the posters are displayed. Go ahead and give them an email!</p>
    <h3> <em> How do I know that the goods being exchanged on this site are legitimate</em></h3>
    <p> Due to our terms of service, this is up to the poster. It is up to the poster to post an image of the item and it is on the person interested in the item to use their best judgement.</p>

    <p> During a highly caffenaited week at the Code Fellows Web Development Bootcamp in Seattle, WA, three young men brainstormed an app that would help build share-economies in communities. Thus the "Good Neighbor" App was born. With three weeks for coding experience under their belt, Reid Vasek, Brian Finck and Eric Timmons completed this app within a week. Below are brief bios about the developers.</p>

    <p>Reid Vasek was born and raised in Tumwater, WA. A graduate from Western Washington University with a B.A in Economics, Reid is passionate about making technology easier to use for the non-technical savvy. He can be reached at vasekrs@gmail.com.
