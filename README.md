# Good Neighbor 
This git contains files for the Good Neighbor web application for the Code Fellows April Web Development Bootcamp.

Ever baked a batch of cookies and needed an extra egg? You would either have to ask a neighbor if they had any spare eggs or go to the supermarket.
Going to the store require putting on real clothes and is just a hassle, so asking a neighbor is by far the best option. 

Though, if you're new to an area then it is just intimidating and awkward to ask the neighbors whom you don't know to see if they could spare an egg.
 
Before April 24th, 2015 you would have to suck it up and go to the store. Now, you can simply use the Good Neighbor app to see if anyone nearby could lend you some eggs. Or if you have extra
groceries lying around, you could act like a good neighbor and offer them up.

Simply enter your location and you will be directed to a page which will display the postings that have been uploaded to Good Neighbor.
Each posting contains a picture of the item, distance from the address which you have inputed and the email address of the poster.
